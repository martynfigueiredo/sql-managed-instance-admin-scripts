# Security Reporting

Scripts in this folder provide comprehensive security reports for SQL Managed Instances and on-prem SQL Server environments.

Use them to audit logins, permissions, role memberships, encryption settings, dynamic data masking, and other security-related aspects across instances and databases. Each script returns an extensive set of columns to deliver deep visibility into security metadata.
