# Query Store Insights

This folder contains scripts that leverage the SQL Server Query Store to analyze query performance on SQL Managed Instances. These scripts help identify top resource-consuming queries, detect plan regressions, and analyze CPU and wait patterns. The goal is to provide actionable insights into workload behavior so administrators can tune performance and maintain consistent query response times.
