This folder contains a collection of utility scripts for tasks that don't fit into other categories. Examples include ad hoc troubleshooting queries, job and agent management helpers, log file and disk space analysis, server configuration checks, and other miscellaneous administration functions that DBAs and support engineers might need from time to time.
