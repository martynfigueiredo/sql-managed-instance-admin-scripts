# Backup Management

This folder contains scripts to monitor and manage backup operations for databases in SQL Managed Instances.

Use these scripts to check the last full, differential, and log backup times for each database, verify backup integrity, ensure backup jobs are running successfully, and highlight databases that may require immediate backup attention.
